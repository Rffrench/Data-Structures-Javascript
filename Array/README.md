# ARRAYS

They are a collection of items of usually one data type stored. Arrays have a fixed size like:
int myArray[5] = [1,2,3,4,5];  --> Java
In Javascript they are dynamic


## How much memory do they use???
int myArray[3]={5,3,20} will take 12 bytes because each value takes 4 bytes or 32 bits!

If I want a bigger array I would have to copy the previous array to a new one that has a bigger size where I can add more elements. In many programming languages arrays are dynamic which means that the process of creating and copying items to new bigger arrays is dynamic. Javascript does that, the programmer does not have to worry about resizing arrays.

 Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed.
