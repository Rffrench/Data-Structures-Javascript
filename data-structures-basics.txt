DATA STRUCTURES


****Â¿What are they?****

A data structure is a way of organizing data that is stored in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. They are different ways of storing data in computers


****Memory**** 
It is a long tape of bytes. Each byte in the RAM is stored in an address. Applications will have an address for them 
Each character is stored as 4 bytes or 32 bits long. (4 x 8 bits) byte = 8 bits.  
Each integer, decimal or string will then take the same amount of Memory.


 Big O notation is important because that will tell how long is an algorithm going to take to complete. Always remember is about Time and complexity
