/*
They are a collection of items of usually one data type stored. Arrays have a fixed size like:
int myArray[5] = [1,2,3,4,5];  --> Java


- How much memory do they use???
int myArray[3]={5,3,20} will take 12 bytes because each value takes 4 bytes or 32 bits!

If I want a bigger array I would have to copy the previous array to a new one that has a bigger size where I can add more elements. In many programming languages arrays are dynamic which means that the process of creating and copying items to new bigger arrays is automatic. Javascript does that?

let myArray = [3, 6, 9];

console.log(myArray);
